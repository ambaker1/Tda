OpenSees is an open-source scripting-based finite-element analysis software, specializing in earthquake engineering simulation \cite{mckenna_nonlinear_2010}. 
One of the scripting languages for OpenSees is Tcl, or Tool Command Language, which is a high-level, general purpose procedural language \cite{ousterhout_tcl_1989}. 
Tda (pronounced "ta-da!") was developed with the OpenSees user in mind, adding much needed data analysis and manipulation tools. 
It adds native n-dimensional arrays, a tabular datatype, file import/export and datatype conversion utilities, and data visualization tools to Tcl, which are compartmentalized into separate sub-packages of Tda.

Tda version \version\ was written for OpenSees 3.3.0 and Tcl 8.6.10. 
Tda was originally developed for OpenSees users, but is general enough for any Tcl application.
